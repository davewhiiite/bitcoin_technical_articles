Misc. collection of articles on Bitcoin CLI, PoW Mining Efficiency

## About
These articles came from a Medium blog I was writing during a cabin-fever-
fueled period of discovery, known in bitcoin circles as "falling down the rabbit hole."
Regrettably, Tether FUD and the objectionable politics of bitcoin
maxis made me want to take it down. But the articles are good, particularly
the onese on measuring an ASIC's "performance ratio," so I
hope they will live on, here. Please let me know if you liked reading them.
